         <p>You get the help you deserve. Together we can stop Sovereign. We don't have to submit to the Reapers. We can beat them! I'm Commander Shepard and this is my favorite store on the Citadel. Turns out basic police yes yes yes work isn't so hard. You just have to leave the station. It's hard enough fighting a war, but it's worse knowing no matter how hard you try you can't save them all.

         <p>Did they have anything that you could eat there? Activate the neutron purge. You falsely accused this girl of stealing from you. All you have to say now is that she 'could have' stolen it? And you. She gets harassed and insulted by this guy, and you throw in a threat to arrest her for vagrancy? I live a dangerous life. Dangerous men fit right in. You were a Spectre. You swore to protect the galaxy. Then you broke that vow to save yourself.

         <p>It's strange. The geth are attacking, and everyone around here is still worried about ordinary business. Who votes to take the vehicle into the creepy underground tunnel? The bartender over there? She's your father. Ha-ah! Donâ€™t make me laugh, damn it. My face is barely holding together as it is. Besides, everyone was always overlooking you and hitting on me. Time for you to get a fair shot. The name of the ship. Your life hangs on the answer.
